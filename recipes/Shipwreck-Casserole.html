<p>Shipwreck Casserole is a hearty, one-pot comfort food classic that's perfect for busy weeknights. This layered casserole gets its name from the "everything but the kitchen sink" approach - layers of ground beef, rice, vegetables, and cheese all baked together. It's filling, flavorful, and requires minimal prep work!</p>
