<p>This classic homemade pizza recipe creates a delicious crispy crust with your favorite toppings. Perfect for a weekend dinner or gathering with friends, this recipe makes enough dough for two 12-inch pizzas. The secret is letting the dough rest properly and using a very hot oven!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Your favorite toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Mix warm water, yeast, and sugar in a bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes until foamy.</li>
    <li>Add flour, olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.</li>
    <li>Punch down the dough and divide in half. Roll out each half into a 12-inch circle.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough to a pizza pan or parchment paper. Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the sauce and add your desired toppings.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
    <li>Let cool for 5 minutes, slice, and enjoy!</li>
